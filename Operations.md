## Built-in operations ##

There are currently over 100 operations built into the framework, divided into the following categories:

### Image generators ###

- **SolidColorGenerator**: This outputs a generated image with a solid color. You need to define the image size using at initialization.
  - *color*: The color that is used to fill the image.

- **CircleGenerator**: This outputs a generated image of a circle, for use in masking. The renderCircleOfRadius() method lets you specify the radius, center, circleColor, and backgroundColor.
  
- **CrosshairGenerator**: This outputs a generated image of a circle, for use in masking. The renderCrosshairs() takes in a series of normalized coordinates and draws crosshairs at those coordinates.
  - *crosshairWidth*: Width, in pixels, of the crosshairs that are drawn.
  - *crosshairColor*: The color of the crosshairs.

### Color adjustments ###

- **BrightnessAdjustment**: Adjusts the brightness of the image
  - *brightness*: The adjusted brightness (-1.0 - 1.0, with 0.0 as the default)

- **ExposureAdjustment**: Adjusts the exposure of the image
  - *exposure*: The adjusted exposure (-10.0 - 10.0, with 0.0 as the default)

- **ContrastAdjustment**: Adjusts the contrast of the image
  - *contrast*: The adjusted contrast (0.0 - 4.0, with 1.0 as the default)

- **SaturationAdjustment**: Adjusts the saturation of an image
  - *saturation*: The degree of saturation or desaturation to apply to the image (0.0 - 2.0, with 1.0 as the default)

- **GammaAdjustment**: Adjusts the gamma of an image
  - *gamma*: The gamma adjustment to apply (0.0 - 3.0, with 1.0 as the default)

- **LevelsAdjustment**: Photoshop-like levels adjustment. The minimum, middle, maximum, minOutput and maxOutput parameters are floats in the range [0, 1]. If you have parameters from Photoshop in the range [0, 255] you must first convert them to be [0, 1]. The gamma/mid parameter is a float >= 0. This matches the value from Photoshop. If you want to apply levels to RGB as well as individual channels you need to use this filter twice - first for the individual channels and then for all channels.

- **ColorMatrixFilter**: Transforms the colors of an image by applying a matrix to them
  - *colorMatrix*: A 4x4 matrix used to transform each color in an image
  - *intensity*: The degree to which the new transformed color replaces the original color for each pixel

- **RGBAdjustment**: Adjusts the individual RGB channels of an image
  - *red*: Normalized values by which each color channel is multiplied. The range is from 0.0 up, with 1.0 as the default.
  - *green*: 
  - *blue*:

- **HueAdjustment**: Adjusts the hue of an image
  - *hue*: The hue angle, in degrees. 90 degrees by default

- **WhiteBalance**: Adjusts the white balance of an image.
  - *temperature*: The temperature to adjust the image by, in ÂºK. A value of 4000 is very cool and 7000 very warm. The default value is 5000. Note that the scale between 4000 and 5000 is nearly as visually significant as that between 5000 and 7000.
  - *tint*: The tint to adjust the image by. A value of -200 is *very* green and 200 is *very* pink. The default value is 0.  

- **HighlightsAndShadows**: Adjusts the shadows and highlights of an image
  - *shadows*: Increase to lighten shadows, from 0.0 to 1.0, with 0.0 as the default.
  - *highlights*: Decrease to darken highlights, from 1.0 to 0.0, with 1.0 as the default.

- **LookupFilter**: Uses an RGB color lookup image to remap the colors in an image. First, use your favourite photo editing application to apply a filter to lookup.png from framework/Operations/LookupImages. For this to work properly each pixel color must not depend on other pixels (e.g. blur will not work). If you need a more complex filter you can create as many lookup tables as required. Once ready, use your new lookup.png file as  the basis of a PictureInput that you provide for the lookupImage property.
  - *intensity*: The intensity of the applied effect, from 0.0 (stock image) to 1.0 (fully applied effect).
  - *lookupImage*: The image to use as the lookup reference, in the form of a PictureInput.

- **AmatorkaFilter**: A photo filter based on a Photoshop action by Amatorka: http://amatorka.deviantart.com/art/Amatorka-Action-2-121069631 . If you want to use this effect you have to add lookup_amatorka.png from the GPUImage framework/Operations/LookupImages folder to your application bundle.

- **MissEtikateFilter**: A photo filter based on a Photoshop action by Miss Etikate: http://miss-etikate.deviantart.com/art/Photoshop-Action-15-120151961 .

  - *threshold*: The luminance threshold, from 0.0 to 1.0, with a default of 0.5

- **AdaptiveThreshold**: Determines the local luminance around a pixel, then turns the pixel black if it is below that local luminance and white if above. This can be useful for picking out text under varying lighting conditions.
  - *blurRadiusInPixels*: A multiplier for the background averaging blur radius in pixels, with a default of 4.

- **AverageLuminanceThreshold**: This applies a thresholding operation where the threshold is continually adjusted based on the average luminance of the scene.
  - *thresholdMultiplier*: This is a factor that the average luminance will be multiplied by in order to arrive at the final threshold to use. By default, this is 1.0.

- **AverageColorExtractor**: This processes an input image and determines the average color of the scene, by averaging the RGBA components for each pixel in the image. A reduction process is used to progressively downsample the source image on the GPU, followed by a short averaging calculation on the CPU. The output from this filter is meaningless, but you need to set the colorAverageProcessingFinishedBlock property to a block that takes in four color components and a frame time and does something with them.

- **AverageLuminanceExtractor**: Like the AverageColorExtractor, this reduces an image to its average luminosity. You need to set the luminosityProcessingFinishedBlock to handle the output of this filter, which just returns a luminosity value and a frame time.

- **ChromaKeying**: For a given color in the image, sets the alpha channel to 0. This is similar to the ChromaKeyBlend, only instead of blending in a second image for a matching color this doesn't take in a second image and just turns a given color transparent.

The output of this filter is a 3-pixel-high, 256-pixel-wide image with the center (vertical) pixels containing pixels that correspond to the frequency at which various color values occurred. Each color value occupies one of the 256 width positions, from 0 on the left to 255 on the right. This histogram can be generated for individual color channels (.Red, .Green, .Blue), the luminance of the image (.Luminance), or for all three color channels at once (.RGB).
  - *downsamplingFactor*: Rather than sampling every pixel, this dictates what fraction of the image is sampled. By default, this is 16 with a minimum of 1. This is needed to keep from saturating the histogram, which can only record 256 pixels for each color value before it becomes overloaded.

- **HistogramDisplay**: This is a special filter, in that it's primarily intended to work with the Histogram. It generates an output representation of the color histograms generated by Histogram, but it could be repurposed to display other kinds of values. It takes in an image and looks at the center (vertical) pixels. It then plots the numerical values of the RGB components in separate colored graphs in an output texture. You may need to force a size for this filter in order to make its output visible.

- **HistogramEqualization**: This takes a image, analyzes its histogram, and equalizes the outbound image based on that.
  - *downsamplingFactor*: Rather than sampling every pixel, this dictates what fraction of the image is sampled by the histogram. By default, this is 16 with a minimum of 1.
